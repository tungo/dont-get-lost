Tony Weng, Tu Ngo, Vilya Levitskiy, and Vincent Chan
 
## Background
 
Inspired by Find Your Friends, Don't Get Lost is an Android App that lets you keep track of your friends- no matter how directionally challenged they might be.
 
## Functionality & MVPs
 
With this app, users should be able to:
 
- [ ] sign in through facebook
- [ ] Create groups
- [ ] Add group members through invites
- [ ] Access a 2D map displaying the locations of said users and their group members

- [Schema](/docs/schema.md)
- [Sample State](/docs/state_slice.md)
 
## Technologies and Technical Implementations
 
This app will be built with React Native. On the backend, we will use Rails and a PostgreSQL database.
We will implement Google/Facebook o-auth as an optional login method for users.
We will use Google Static Maps API and implement a websocket to update positions in real time.
 
## Project Breakdown
 
O-auth, regular backend auth, frontend components (groups, group detail, menu, map, login screen, invites index), web socket, models (users, groups, invites), controllers (users, sessions, groups, invites, application), database (users, groups, invites), actions (), api utils (), reducers, etc. Time needed to learn new technologies.
